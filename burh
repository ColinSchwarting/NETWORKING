What is the Berkeley Packet Filter, using tcpdump, to capture all packets with a ttl of 64 and less, utilizing the IPv4 or IPv6 Headers? 
There should be 4880 packets.

sudo tcpdump 'ip[8]'<=64 || 'ip6[7]<=64'

what the hell is a socket, gunny?
at a minimum, it's a ip and port
  stream sockets
    connection oriented, tcp, handshake and teardown
  datagram sockets
    connectionless, udp, quick and easy
  raw sockets
    just fucking send it
    
 
user space sockets:
    --doesn't need elevated privs
    
kernel space sockets:
    --DOES need sudo 

user space applications/sockets
   tcpdump to read file
   nmap with no switches
   netcat connect to listener
   netcat to create listener above well know ports (1024+)
   using /dev/tcp or /dev/udp to transmit data

kernel space applications/sockets
  tcpdump/wireshark to capture packets
  nmap for os identification
  netcat to create listener (0-1023)
  scapy to craft packets
  python to craft/modify for transmission
  network devices using routing protocols
    
raw sockets
  must include ipheaders and the next headers
  avoids defense mechanisms
  sneaky squirel shit
