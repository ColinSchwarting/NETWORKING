What is the Berkeley Packet Filter, using tcpdump, to capture all packets with a ttl of 64 and less, utilizing the IPv4 or IPv6 Headers? 
There should be 4880 packets.

sudo tcpdump 'ip[8]'<=64 || 'ip6[7]<=64'

what the hell is a socket, gunny?
at a minimum, it's a ip and port
  stream sockets
    connection oriented, tcp, handshake and teardown
  datagram sockets
    connectionless, udp, quick and easy
  raw sockets
    just fucking send it
    
 
user space sockets:
    --doesn't need elevated privs
    
kernel space sockets:
    --DOES need sudo 

user space applications/sockets
   tcpdump to read file
   nmap with no switches
   netcat connect to listener
   netcat to create listener above well know ports (1024+)
   using /dev/tcp or /dev/udp to transmit data

kernel space applications/sockets
  tcpdump/wireshark to capture packets
  nmap for os identification
  netcat to create listener (0-1023)
  scapy to craft packets
  python to craft/modify for transmission
  network devices using routing protocols
    
raw sockets
  must include ipheaders and the next headers
  avoids defense mechanisms
  sneaky squirel shit
  
  
NETWORK RECON

Passive

)

passive: possible tools
            whois (built in command or website)
                whois google.com
            DNS queries
                viewdns.info
            jobsite
                can create profiles on people based on public job listing
            phone numbers
                find personal info from phonenumber
            google searches
                can find info through google
            passive OS fingerprinting
                can determine what a system is based off of different factors such as ttl
            
           DIG:::
            can use dig to find infomation from a domain
                dig ccboe.net
                dig ccboe.net SOA
                              TXT
                              ANY
                dig -x 1.2.3.4 << reverse lookup
                             ^^^^^^^this can specify what youre looking for from the site

scan network:
  sudo nmap -T4 -p 1-1023 [IP/CIDR]
  ssh (probably tunnel) into device
      host enumeration:
          hostname
          show interfaces
          show arp?
  MAP where you are!!!
  MAP THE CONNECTING DEVICES
  if you see a webserver:
    wget -r IP:PORT

DATA TRANSFER

TFTP: RFC 1350
  UDP Transport
  Small and simple comms
  
FTP: RFC 959
  TCP Transport
  Multiple TCP connections

SFTP: 
  TCP Transport (over SSH)
  Uses encryption
  
FTPS:
  Uses PKI authentication

wget -r ftp://[ip addy]
scp student@ip.add.ress.es:/home/userMyText.txt /MyLocal/directory
##through a tunnel
make a tunnel:
  ssh student@172.16.82.106 -L 1111:localhost:22 -NT
SCP through the tunnel:
  scp -P 1111 student@localhost:secretstuff.txt /home/student
